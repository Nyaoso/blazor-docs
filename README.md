# Documentation Guidelines 

This section contains guidelines on naming files, sections, documents and other document elements.

> **NOTE**: Some of the items are marked as TODO which will be documented later.


## HotFix and Master branch usage

The HotFix branch name will be in the below pattern:  

https://gitlab.syncfusion.com/content/blazor-docs/tree/hotfix/hotfix-v{last major release version}
 
For example the latest HotFix branch is:
https://gitlab.syncfusion.com/content/blazor-docs/tree/hotfix/hotfix-v19.2.0.55


**For Daily UG publishing to live**

HotFix branch has been created for blazor-docs repository. hereafter use this HotFix branch to commit your daily changes as like ES.

https://gitlab.synthofusion.com/content/blazor-docs/tree/hotfix/hotfix-v19.2.0.55

We will merge the changes from HotFix to Master and publish to live from Master branch hereafter.

**For release UG publishing (Main\SP)**

You can use the development branch to commit the changes for Main\SP release.

We will merge development branch to Master during release time as like other ES platforms and publish to live from Master branch and create HotFix for next version

---
```

## General guidelines

Refer the below guidelines for adding description, title and h1 tags.

[Format+of+meta+elements+for+UG+pages](https://syncfusion.sharepoint.com/sites/GH/SEO/SitePages/Format%20of%20meta%20elements%20for%20UG%20pages.aspx)

Also refer the below link for common validation errors and solution for this errors in below.

## Spelling and file naming conventions errors handling

Refer the below guidelines to resolve spelling errors in the documentation.

Spelling -  https://syncfusion.sharepoint.com/sites/DOCINFRA/SitePages/Spell%20Checker%20Automation%20-%20Guide.aspx

File name - https://syncfusion.sharepoint.com/sites/DOCINFRA/SitePages/File%20Path%20Validation%20%20Guidelines.aspx


## File naming Convention:
* All files should have `.md` extension.
* Separate words in file names should be hyphenated
* File names of the documents should have one or two-word names that describe the material covered in the document. 
* The full title of the document should be in the file name. 
* Phrase title and description in a way that users can determine what questions the text will answer, and material that will be addressed, without reading the content. This eases the time spent looking for answers, and improvises search/scanning, and possibly **SEO**.
* Provide titles and headers in the form of “Using foo” over “How to Foo.”

> For example, at the top section of each MD file,

> **Title :** Getting started with Chart widget for Syncfusion Essential JS 

> **Description :** How to create a chart, add series, enable tooltip and other functionalities.


## Markdown Syntax Guideline
* Follow the syntax mentioned in this [link](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for most of the elements. There are some elements which need special styling or additional settings to do. Those have been described in the below topics.

## General
* Do not bold the words unnecessarily.
* Use [inline code style](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#inline-code) wherever it is possible to highlight the keywords, variables or one line code examples that come within the paragraph.

### Cross-reference
* Link within the page (if you have a title with space, use hyphen (-))

>	**Syntax**: \[Link name](#title-name)

>	**Example**: \[How to best read this user guide] (#how-to-best-read-this-user-guide)

* Link to the other page within the same platform documentation (using relative path). Tooltip text is optional.

> **Syntax**: \[Link name](relative path "Tooltip text")

> **Example**: \[Barcode](/js/Barcode/Getting-Started "Barcode Getting Started")

### Table
* Use the [kramdown syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#tables) for creating the tables.
* **Advanced tables**: If you want to create an advanced tables with row span or column span or with code snippets, you can go with the standard html table syntax as described below.

> 1. start with `<table>` tag. Tag should be left indented and should have empty space in left side. 

> 2. Provide `TH` tag for table headers.

> 3. Code snippet can include within `<td> [code snippet] </td>`. Follow the same pattern like code snippet. 

* Do not provide table captions.
* You should use the below markdown syntax if you want to use markdown syntax within the html tags.

> \{{'<MarkdownSyntax>' | markdownify }}

> **Example**:

> \{{'\[syncfusion](http://cdn.syncfusion.com/js/assets/external/jquery-1.10.2.min.js)'| markdownify }}



### Image

* Make sure image is not resized or blurred. 
* Caption is not necessary to provide for all images except for the case where we will have displayed more than one image.

* Adding Image : General markdown [syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#images) will work.

> **Syntax**: \!\[Alt text](imagepath)

> **Example**: \!\[Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

* Adding image with caption:

> **Syntax**: \{% include image.html url="image path" caption="caption text"%}

> **Example**: \{% include image.html url="/js/DatePicker/Appearance-and-Styling_images/Appearance-and-Styling_img2.png" caption="caption text"%}

* Maximum width of the image should be 750 PX
* Maximum height of the image should be 550 PX
* Image format should be either .jpeg or .png format 
* Size of the image should not exceed  20 to 40 KB  
* If you are including the image to show an output of a code block, make sure the exact output can see the user also when he executes the same code snippet.

### Code Blocks
* Refer [this page](http://haisum.github.io/2014/11/07/jekyll-pygments-supported-highlighters/) for Code block syntax and supported languages.
* Align the code snippets using following free formatters:
	[JS](http://jsbeautifier.org/) ,
	[HTML](http://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html)
* Remove extra lines added within the code block.
* Make sure the given code block runs without any issues.
* JSRender template syntax can be rendered by the following syntax :

> \{{"{{"}} code block here {{}}}}
